Code-Quiz  Homework-4

This is my first project utilizing html, CSS and jquery to create a timed short quiz comprised of 5 multiple choice questions related to basic javascrip concepts.

Objective: From scratch, build a timer-based quiz application that stores high scores client-side.

Play proceeds as follows:

The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.

Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).

When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in localStorage.
