<!--
The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.

Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).

When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in localStorage.
Once the quiz begins, a timer starts.

If a question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer.

The timer stops when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0.

After the game ends, the user can save their initials and score to a highscores view using local storage.-->
